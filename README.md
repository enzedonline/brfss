# **Introduction**

The report produced here was an exercise as part of the Duke University Introduction to Probability and Data with R course as part of the Statistics with R Specialization.

The study uses the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) processed data. The data was supplied by Duke University as a zipped RData file, downloadable from [this site](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/4tiY2fqCQa-YmNn6gnGvzQ_1e7320c30a6f4b27894a54e2de50a805_brfss2013.RData?Expires=1644364800&Signature=WyfTbYrzTK7Uozw9DneS6rXi-Q5tsOOcr0YzqqH0l6rsgXIobGtw26AQ~k~FvVYuPXnaz69zB1EfrO08IP9ZwpMwqf3hqWD1dsfwqlBx5bATtDMGEFblJFILJhs2p-8-DR3ysZrbmagfERINtO378OJM9I~iePQuOoqglu7Z4uY_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A).

The unzipped file has no file extension, you will need to rename it to `brfss2013.RData` to use the code as is, or amend the code accordingly.

The report is generated via the R markdown file `intro_data_prob_project.Rmd` which contains all the necessary code to process from the raw data table. `scratch.R` is just a working space used to develop the code en route to producing the report.

The viewable report is published to <https://rpubs.com/enzedonline/brfss>.
